\chapter{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

This thesis has investigated the possibilities of using compositions of distributional semantic vectors for sentiment classification of utterances. The work has mainly been focused on finding an optimal parameter tuning for the DSM, where the results concluded that more associative window sizes performed better than less associative ones. Weighting the DSM by PPMI gave the most stable performance improvements as well. Context selection is essential for achieving higher scores.

While the model does not reach beyond baseline levels in its evaluation, there are still unexplored areas in which potential improvements may lie, mainly in the investigation of composition operators beyond a simple additive model.
